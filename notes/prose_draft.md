    1.1 A Kelp Crisis
        
        California is currently experiencing a devastating die-off of its kelp forests, a crisis largely attributed to an explosion in pacific purple sea urchin populations. This urchin surge began after their natural predator, the sunflower sea star, suffered a catastrophic decline due to sea star wasting syndrome, which emerged around 2013. The disease pushed the sunflower sea star to the brink of extinction, leading to its current critically endangered status. With their primary predator virtually gone, purple sea urchin populations have exploded. These unchecked urchins, which feed on kelp, are now responsible for the destruction of vast kelp forests, with estimates indicating an 80% loss in Northern California since 2013 (Zuckerman, 2023).

    1.2 The Need for Intervention

        Intervention through manual urchin destruction by divers is possible, but the scarcity of these skilled individuals demands an efficient allocation strategy. The West Coast Region Kelp Team underscores this by calling for an efficient way to "conduct annual assessments of kelp forest ecosystem health" (Hohman et al., 2023, p. 5). The rationale is straightforward: areas identified with poor kelp health are likely to harbor high concentrations of urchins. Consequently, these assessments would enable dive teams to strategically target urchin removal efforts in these compromised zones, thereby creating conditions more favorable for kelp recovery and regrowth.

    1.3 Challenges with Existing Monitoring Methods and Why New Methods Are Needed

        Current kelp monitoring techniques, such as costly scuba diver surveys, struggle with scalability. This inherent limitation in spatial coverage per dive makes it impractical to assess vast coastlines comprehensively using only diver-based methods. Aerial surveys, while covering larger areas, share the issue of high cost and introduce the burden of repetitive human annotation. For example, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife annually conducts flights to photograph the ocean surface along the California coast. Scientists then manually analyze these images to perform kelp canopy mapping, a process that involves visually identifying kelp floating on the surface and meticulously calculating its total area, often expressed in square feet. This process is demonstrably expensive, time-consuming, and repetitive, prompting an urgent need to explore whether this critical monitoring task can be automated.
